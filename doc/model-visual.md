# Model Visualization

## Textual Output

In low- to medium-complexity applications, the simplest way of examining the
performance models generated by dfatool is textual output: `--show-model=param`.
This is implemented for most modeling methods.

## Graphical Output via dot(1)

`--export-dot PREFIX` exports the generated performance models for each pair of
name (state/transition/â€¦) and performance attribute to
`PREFIX(name)-(attribute).dot`. The dot(1) program is capable of transforming
those into images. For instance, if feh(1) is available, a visual model is
accessible via `dot -Tpng filename.dot | feh -`.

In case of regression forests (XGBoost), dfatool exports the individual trees to
`PREFIX(name)-(attribute).(index).dot`.

## Plotting Model Predictions for Individual Configurations

`--plot-param name:attribute:label` displays both raw readings (as points, see
[[analysis-visual.md]]) and the corresponding performance model (as lines).
